           <h3>TERMS &  CONDITIONS</h3><br/>
This Sheep Game Terms and Conditions (this “Agreement”) is a legally binding agreement by and between
Subzero Labs LLC (“The Sheep Game Developers” or “us” or “we”) and any owner of any Woolf (defined below)
(“you” or “Purchaser”). The Sheep Game Developers and each Purchaser may be referred to throughout this
Agreement collectively as the “Parties” or individually as a “Party”. By purchasing or otherwise owning a Woolf,
you acknowledge that  you have carefully read and agree to the terms of this Agreement.<br/>
This website and its connected services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranty of any kind. By
using this website you are accepting sole responsibility for any and all transactions involving Sheep Game digital
collectibles.<br/><br/>
Your purchase from The Sheep Game Developers or purchase from any owner of an NFT originally
produced by The Sheep Game Developers does not constitute a financial investment. You are buying a
piece of art that lives on the Avalanche blockchain.<br/><br/>
WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE
ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN
IN COURT.<br/><br/>
1. <strong>Agreement to Terms.</strong> “Woolf” refers to a non-fungible token (NFT) (i.e., a controllable electronic record
recorded on a blockchain) that, as of its genesis issuance, is linked to an image of a wolf or sheep, as
applicable. “Woolf Art” means the image of the specific sheep or wolf linked to a particular NFT, which images
consists of elements of art compiled by the underlying Sheep Game smart contract. For avoidance of doubt, the
Woolf Art is digital in nature and does not include, is not linked to, and is not sold together with, any items or
representations that have physical dimensions such as mass or volume.<br/>
(a) Additional Terms: Woolfs may be available for purchase on one or more third-party platforms,
such as OpenSea (each, a “NFT Marketplace”), which we do not operate. The access and use of the
NFT Marketplace are subject to the separate terms of the NFT Marketplace.<br/><br/><br/>
2. <strong>Ownership of Woolf.</strong><br/>
(a) When Purchaser acquires a Woolf, Purchaser owns all personal property rights to that Woolf
(e.g., the right to freely sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of that Woolf). The Woolf Art, however, is free for
use by anyone for any purpose without restriction under copyright law. Public domain is the purest form
of open and free, since no one owns or controls the material in any way.<br/><br/>
(b) Purchaser represents and warrants that it will not transfer a  Woolf in any subsequent
transaction to a Transferee that is (i) located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo,
or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a terrorist-supporting country; or is (ii) listed on
any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties (“Prohibited Transferees”).<br/><br/><br/>
3. <strong>Fees and Payments</strong><br/>
(a) If you elect to purchase a Woolf through the website, any financial transactions that you engage in will
be conducted solely through the Avalanche network. We will have no insight into or control over these
payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions.  We will have no
liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any
transactions that you engage or any other transactions that you conduct via the Avalanche network.<br/><br/>
(b) Avalanche requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on
the Avalanche network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized
Avalanche network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction.<br/><br/><br/>
4. Transfers. All subsequent transactions of the Woolfs are subject to the following terms: (a) the Woolf
transferee (the “Transferee”) shall, by purchasing, accepting, accessing or otherwise using the Woolf or Woolf
Art, be deemed to accept all of the terms of this Agreement as a “Purchaser” hereof; and (b) the Woolf transferor
(the “Transferor”) shall provide notice to the Transferee of this Agreement, including a link or other method by
which the terms of this Agreement can be accessible by the Transferee. Purchaser further acknowledges and
agrees that all subsequent transactions of the Woolf will be effected on the blockchain network governing the
Woolf, and Purchaser will be required to make or receive payments  exclusively  through its  cryptocurrency
wallet.<br/><br/><br/>
5. <strong>The Sheep Game Developers’  Rights  and Obligations to the  Woolf Art  and Woolfs.</strong> The Parties
acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for repairing, supporting, replacing, or maintaining any
website.<br/><br/><br/>
6. <strong>Warranty Disclaimers and Assumption of Risk.</strong> Purchaser represents and warrants that it (a) is the
age of majority in Purchaser’s place of residence (which is typically 18 years of age in most U.S. states) and has
the legal capacity to enter into this Agreement, (b) that Purchaser will use and interact with the Woolfs and
Woolfs Art only for lawful purposes and in accordance with this Agreement, and (c) that Purchaser will not use
the Woolfs or Woolfs Art to violate any law, regulation or ordinance or any right of The Sheep Game Developers,
its licensors or any third party, including without limitation, any right of privacy, publicity, copyright, trademark, or
patent. Purchaser further agrees that it will comply with all applicable law.<br/>
THE WOOLFS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING  THE
FOREGOING,  THE   WOLF   GAME   DEVELOPERS  EXPLICITLY  DISCLAIM  ANY  IMPLIED  WARRANTIES  OF
MERCHANTABILITY,  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR  PURPOSE,  QUIET  ENJOYMENT  AND  NON-
INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.
THE WOLF GAME DEVELOPERS MAKE  NO  WARRANTY  THAT  THE  WOOLFS  WILL  MEET  PURCHASER’S
REQUIREMENTS  OR  BE  AVAILABLE  ON  AN  UNINTERRUPTED,  SECURE,  OR  ERROR-FREE  BASIS.  THE
WOLF   GAME   DEVELOPERS   MAKE  NO  WARRANTY  REGARDING  THE  QUALITY,  ACCURACY,
TIMELINESS, TRUTHFULNESS,   COMPLETENESS  OR   RELIABILITY   OF   ANY  INFORMATION   OR   CONTENT   ON   THE
WOOLFS.<br/><br/>
THE WOLF GAME DEVELOPERS WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO PURCHASER FOR ANY LOSS
AND TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR, ANY USE OF THE WOOLF,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM: (I) USER ERROR
SUCH   AS   FORGOTTEN   PASSWORDS,   INCORRECTLY   CONSTRUCTED   TRANSACTIONS,   OR   MISTYPED
WALLET   ADDRESSES;   (II)   SERVER   FAILURE   OR   DATA   LOSS;   (III)   CORRUPTED   CRYPTOCURRENCY
WALLET   FILES;   (IV)   UNAUTHORIZED   ACCESS   TO   THE   WOOLF;   OR   (V)   ANY   UNAUTHORIZED   THIRD
PARTY  ACTIVITIES,  INCLUDING  WITHOUT  LIMITATION  THE  USE  OF  VIRUSES,  PHISHING,
BRUTEFORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF ATTACK AGAINST BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK UNDERLYING THE
WOOLFS.<br/><br/>
THE  WOOLFS  ARE  INTANGIBLE  DIGITAL  ASSETS.  THEY  EXIST  ONLY  BY  VIRTUE  OF  THE  OWNERSHIP
RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE APPLICABLE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. ANY TRANSFER OF  TITLE  THAT
MIGHT  OCCUR  IN  ANY  UNIQUE  DIGITAL  ASSET  OCCURS  ON  THE  DECENTRALIZED  LEDGER  WITHIN
SUCH BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK, WHICH WE DO NOT CONTROL. THE WOLF GAME DEVELOPERS DO NOT
GUARANTEE THAT THE WOLF GAME DEVELOPERS CAN EFFECT THE TRANSFER OF TITLE OR RIGHT IN
ANY  WOOLF.  PURCHASER BEARS FULL  RESPONSIBILITY FOR VERIFYING  THE  IDENTITY,  LEGITIMACY,
AND  AUTHENTICITY  OF  ASSETS  PURCHASER  PURCHASES  THROUGH  THE  NFT  MARKETPLACE.
NOTWITHSTANDING   INDICATORS   AND   MESSAGES   THAT   SUGGEST   VERIFICATION,  WE   MAKE   NO
CLAIMS   ABOUT   THE   IDENTITY,   LEGITIMACY,   OR   AUTHENTICITY   OF  ASSETS   ON  THE  NFT
MARKETPLACE OR ANY PURPORTED SUBSEQUENT TRANSACTIONS.<br/><br/>
WE  ARE  NOT  RESPONSIBLE  ANY  KIND  OF  FAILURE,  ABNORMAL  BEHAVIOR  OF  SOFTWARE  (E.G.,
WALLET,  SMART  CONTRACT),  BLOCKCHAINS  OR  ANY  OTHER  FEATURES  OF  THE  WOOLFS.  THE WOLF
GAME DEVELOPERS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CASUALTIES DUE TO LATE REPORT BY DEVELOPERS
OR  REPRESENTATIVES (OR NO REPORT AT ALL) OF ANY ISSUES WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN SUPPORTING
THE   WOOLFS,   INCLUDING   FORKS,   TECHNICAL   NODE   ISSUES   OR   ANY   OTHER   ISSUES   HAVING  FUND
LOSSES AS A RESULT.<br/><br/>
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES IN CONTRACTS WITH
CONSUMERS, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br/><br/><br/>

7. <strong>Assumption of Risk.</strong> Purchaser accepts and acknowledges all risks associated with the following:<br/>
(a) Purchaser is solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to Purchaser’s
purchase,  sale,  or  transfer  of  the  Woolfs.  The Sheep Game Developers  are  not  responsible  for
determining or paying the taxes that apply to such transactions.<br/><br/>
(b) We do not store, send, or receive cryptocurrency assets. Any transfer of cryptocurrency
assets occurs within the supporting blockchain that is not controlled by us. Transactions of the Woolfs
may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be
recoverable. Some transactions of the Woolfs shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public
blockchain ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that Purchaser initiated the transaction.<br/><br/>
(c) There are risks associated with using an Internet based digital asset, including but not
limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet  connections, the risk of  malicious software
introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within
your Wallet. The Sheep Game Developers will not be responsible for any communication failures,
disruptions, errors,  distortions  or  delays  you  may  experience  when  effecting  Woolf  transactions,
however caused.<br/><br/>
(d) Digital assets, including blockchain based assets such as the Woolfs, are subject to
developing laws and regulations throughout the world.<br/><br/><br/>
8. <strong>Indemnity.</strong>     Purchaser shall defend, indemnify, and hold The Sheep Game Developers, its licensors
and affiliates (the “Indemnified Parties”) harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs,
investigations, liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties, settlements, interest, and expenses (including attorneys’
fees) that directly or indirectly arise from or are related to any claim, suit, action, demand, or proceeding made
or brought by a third party (including any person who accesses or transacts using the Woolfs whether or not
such  person  personally  purchased  the  Woolfs)  against  the  Indemnified  Parties,  or  on  account  of  the
investigation,  defense,  or  settlement  thereof,  arising  out  of  or  in  connection  with  your  breach  of  this
Agreement.<br/><br/><br/>
9. <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong><br/>
(a) TO   THE   MAXIMUM   EXTENT   PERMITTED   BY   LAW,   NEITHER   THE   WOLF   GAME
DEVELOPERS NOR ITS  SERVICE  PROVIDERS,  INVOLVED  IN  CREATING,  PRODUCING,  OR
DELIVERING THE WOOLFS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR
CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES,  OR  DAMAGES  FOR  LOST  PROFITS,  LOST  REVENUES,  LOST
SAVINGS,  LOST  BUSINESS  OPPORTUNITY,  LOSS  OF  DATA  OR  GOODWILL,  SERVICE
INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE
WOOLFS OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM
THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE OR INTERACT WITH THE WOOLFS OR ACCESS THE WOOLF
ART,   WHETHER   BASED   ON   WARRANTY,   CONTRACT,   TORT   (INCLUDING  NEGLIGENCE),
PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT  THE WOLF
GAME DEVELOPERS OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF  SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE
FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.<br/><br/>
(b) TO  THE  MAXIMUM  EXTENT  PERMITTED  BY  THE  LAW  OF  THE  APPLICABLE
JURISDICTION, IN NO EVENT WILL THE WOLF GAME DEVELOPERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE OR
INTERACT WITH THE WOOLFS OR ACCESS THE WOOLF ART EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A)
THE AMOUNT YOU ACTUALLY PAUD US UNDER THESE TERMS IN THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS, OR
(B) $500.<br/><br/>
(c) THE  EXCLUSIONS  AND  LIMITATIONS  OF  DAMAGES  SET  FORTH  ABOVE  ARE
FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE WOLF GAME
DEVELOPERS AND PURCHASER.<br/><br/><br/>
10. <strong>Governing Law and Forum Choice.</strong> This Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed
by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise
expressly set forth in Section 11 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below)
that Purchaser and  The Sheep Game Developers are not required to arbitrate will be the courts located in
Delaware, and Purchaser and The Sheep Game Developers each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in
such courts.<br/><br/><br/>
11. <strong>Dispute Resolution.</strong><br/>
(a) Mandatory      A  rbitration      of      Disputes   .  The  Parties  each  agree  that  any  dispute,  claim  or
controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
validity  thereof of the Woolfs transaction (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved  solely   by   binding,
individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and
The Sheep Game Developers are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This
arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.<br/><br/>
(b) Exceptions   . As limited exceptions to Section 11(a) above: (i) both Parties may seek to resolve a
Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) both Parties each retain the right to seek injunctive or
other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our
intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>
(c) Conducting      Arbitration      and      Arbitration      Rules   . The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under
its JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) then in effect, except
as modified by this Agreement. The JAMS Rules are available at https://www.jamsadr.com/. A party who
wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to JAMS and give notice to the
other  party  as  specified  in  the  JAMS  Rules.  JAMS  provides  a  form  Demand  for  Arbitration  at
https://www.jamsadr.com/.<br/><br/>
Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to
a different location but any such arbitration will be conducted remotely to the extent permitted by the
JAMS Rules. The Parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues
relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.<br/><br/>
(d) Arbitration Costs   . Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the
JAMS Rules, and The Sheep Game Developers won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees The
Sheep Game Developers is responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If The Wolf
Game Developers prevail in arbitration it will pay for all of its attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover
them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the
extent provided under applicable law.<br/><br/>
(e) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief   . Except as provided in Section 11(b) above, the arbitrator
shall  determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award
declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary
to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or The Sheep Game Developers
prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and
effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such
relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that
litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any
individual claims in arbitration.<br/><br/>
(f) Class      Action      Waiver   . YOU AND THE WOLF GAME DEVELOPERS AGREE THAT EACH MAY
BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT
AS  A  PLAINTIFF  OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not
consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the
entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.<br/><br/>
(g) Severability   . With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 11(f) of this Agreement
(“Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of this
Agreement is  invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement will still apply.<br/><br/><br/>
12. Woolfs may accumulate a utility token (“WOOL”) when they are staked in the smart contract. WOOL is built for
one purpose and one purpose only: to enable you to mint more Woolfs within the Sheep Game ecosystem. WOOL
has no other functionality other than within the Sheep Game ecosystem, and it cannot be purchased from The Sheep Game Developers. It can only
be accumulated by staking your Woolfs. The Sheep Game Developers do not provide or intend to provide a
secondary marketplace for WOOL.<br/><br/><br/>
13. <strong>General Terms.</strong> This Agreement will transfer and be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the
parties and their permitted successors and assigns, in particular any Transferee. This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement, and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous representations, understandings and
agreements, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, all of which are hereby
merged into this Agreement. Without limitation, the terms of any other document, course of dealing, or course of
trade will not modify this Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Agreement or as the Parties may
agree in writing. No amendment to this Agreement or waiver of any provision hereof will be valid or binding
unless reduced to writing and duly executed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby. Failure to promptly
enforce a provision of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of such provision. Nothing contained in
this Agreement will be deemed to create, or be construed as creating, a joint venture or partnership between the
parties. Neither Party is, by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, authorized as an agent or legal representative
of the other Party. Neither Party to this Agreement is granted any right or authority to assume or to create any
obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on behalf or in the name of the other party, or to bind such other
Party in any manner. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to create any third-party beneficiary
right upon any third party whatsoever. Each of the Parties acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to have
this Agreement reviewed or not by independent legal counsel of its choice. If any one or more of the provisions
of this Agreement should be ruled wholly or partly invalid or unenforceable, then the provisions held invalid or
unenforceable will be deemed amended, and the court or other government body is authorized to reform the
provision(s)  to  the  minimum  extent  necessary  to  render  them  valid  and  enforceable  in  conformity  with  the
parties’  intent as manifested herein. The headings to Sections of this Agreement are for convenience or
reference only and do not form a part of this Agreement and will not in any way affect its interpretation. Neither
Party will be afforded or denied preference in the construction of this Agreement, whether by virtue of being the
drafter or otherwise. For purposes of this Agreement, the words and phrases “include,” “includes”, “including”
and “such as” are deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”. The Parties have agreed to contract
electronically, and accordingly, electronic signatures will be given the same effect and weight as originals.
